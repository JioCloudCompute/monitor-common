Monitoring has following parts:

- Logging
    - Logger
    - Rotator
    - Consumer
- Log monitoring

##Logging
Logging is responsible for log generation and log management (archiving the log to object storage). It provides framework to write the information to the log.

###Logger
Logger provides artifacts 
 - to create log files
 - to write the required information on the log file. Following information are written on the log:
    - Key
    - Value
    - Type
    - Zone

###Rotator
Rotator is to archive the log every 1 minute. In each one minute, it moves the log to a new file where name is appended by timestamp. While moving the log, it must ensure that sanity of the log is maintained. It means that the log information should of a single log action must not be split into two or more files.

###Consumer
Consumer acts on the log files which are moved by rotator. It converts them into JSON format (for easy parsing) and store them into object store.

##Log Monitoring
This framework involves parsing and monitoring of the logs generated by the producer (application component). It is yet to be detailed out.
